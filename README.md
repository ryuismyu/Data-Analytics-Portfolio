## Projects

### 1️) [Superstore Sales Analysis](https://github.com/ryuismyu/Superstore-Sales-Analysis)  
This dashboard provides a detailed analysis of Superstore sales data across time, regions, and product categories. Once downloaded, viewers can filter by year, region, and  state to explore top selling categoreis and moniter key KPIs such as Total sales, number of orders, and average order value. The dataset was cleaned using excel and built using Power BI where I used DAX measures to make key KPIs and business insights possible.

This project explores Airbnb listings in New York City, analyzing pricing trends, room types, and neighborhood demand. This dashboard highlights the most high demand areas (both by neighbourhood and room type) as well as pricing patterns to make hosts and guests make informed descisions. Data wrangling was done in SQL, and analysis was done in both SQL and excel, with the dashboard and pivot tables also made in excel.
